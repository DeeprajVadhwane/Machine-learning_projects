# Health Insurance Exploratory Data Analysis

Welcome to the Insurance Insights Project! This repository is dedicated to unraveling game-changing insights from a dataset associated with health insurance. Here's a glimpse into the transformative discoveries made in this project:

## Business/Domain Understanding

Health insurance in India is an emerging sector driven by factors such as the rise in the middle class, higher hospitalization costs, expensive healthcare, digitization, and increased awareness. Insurance companies face the challenge of setting accurate insurance premiums based on limited information about the insured population. Estimating average medical care expenses becomes crucial to make profitable decisions.

### What is Insurance?

Insurance is a contract between two parties where one party agrees to undertake the risk of the other in exchange for a premium. It promises to indemnify the party on the happening of an uncertain event.

### What is Health Insurance?

Health insurance is a plan that covers or shares the expenses associated with healthcare.

### BMI and How Insurance Companies Work

BMI (Body Mass Index) is used by insurance companies as a health assessment tool. It is calculated using the formula:

\[ BMI = \frac{{\text{{Weight in kilograms}}}}{{(\text{{Height in meters}})^2}} \]

Insurance companies use BMI to:

- Price premiums: Individuals with a high BMI may face higher premiums due to associated health risks.
- Make underwriting decisions: BMI is used with other health-related information to determine insurability and premium rates.
- Set policy limits and exclusions: Policies may have limitations or exclusions based on BMI and overall health.

## Data Dictionary

- `age`: Age of the primary beneficiary
- `sex`: Insurance contractor gender (female, male)
- `bmi`: Body mass index (kg/m^2)
- `children`: Number of dependents
- `smoker`: Smoking status (yes, no)
- `region`: Beneficiary's residential area in the US (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest)
- `charges`: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance

## Task - Exploratory Data Analysis

Assume you are working as a Data Scientist with a leading insurance provider. This open-ended exploration involves performing an EDA on the given dataset. The target variable is known to be `Charges`. Mandatory tasks for your presentation:

1. Identify the most significant variables with respect to the target variable.
2. Explore the data distribution of each column and identify important patterns.
3. Provide insights and recommendations for data-driven business decisions.


## Key Insights

1. **Age vs. Charges:**
   - Charges increase with age, indicating a positive correlation.

2. **Smoking Impact:**
   - Smokers tend to have higher charges compared to non-smokers.

3. **BMI Influence:**
   - BMI shows a direct correlation with charges. As BMI increases, charges also increase.

4. **Children and Charges:**
   - Individuals with 0 or 1 child tend to have higher charges.

5. **Region Considerations:**
   - Charges are distributed relatively equally across different regions.

## Recommendations

- Consider age, smoking status, BMI, and the number of children as key factors when pricing premiums.
- Tailor insurance offerings for individuals with specific health characteristics to optimize risk and coverage.
- Monitor regional trends but ensure a fair and consistent distribution of charges.

## Conclusions

This exploratory analysis provides valuable insights into factors influencing healthcare charges. By incorporating these findings, the insurance company can make informed decisions on premium pricing, underwriting, and policy structures. Regular monitoring and adaptation to changing trends will contribute to the company's long-term success.
